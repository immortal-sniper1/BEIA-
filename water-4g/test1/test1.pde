/*



A code for reading the sensor is shown below:
int value;
{
SensorEventv20.ON();
delay(10);
value = SensorEventv20.readValue(SOCKET);
}
value is an integer variable where the sensor state (a high value (3.3V) indicating liquid presence or a low value (0V) indicating
its absence) will be stored.
SOCKET indicates on which connector the sensor is placed (for this sensor it may be SENS_SOCKET1, SENS_SOCKET2, SENS_
SOCKET3 and SENS_SOCKET8).
